                Environmental and ecological damage
            </h2>
            <img src="../../images/grand-palais-ephemere-construction.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                Despite efforts to make the Olympic Games more sustainable, their ecological footprint has attracted criticism. The installation of temporary structures, such as the beach volleyball stadium on the Champ-de-Mars, has raised concerns about their impact on natural areas and historic sites. The transportation of the materials needed to build these infrastructures has also been singled out by environmental associations, who deplore the carbon footprint generated by the event.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, waste management and energy consumption, although partially offset by ecological initiatives, were not enough to allay concerns about the overall impact of the Games on the environment.

        <div>
            <h2>
                Saturation of local infrastructures
            </h2>
            <img src="../../images/metro-sature.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                The management of visitor flows during the Olympic Games led to saturation of public transport and road infrastructures, making travel more complicated for local residents. For example, metro line 13 was particularly congested, creating inconvenience for suburban residents such as those in Saint-Ouen and La Courneuve.
            </p>
            <p>
                What's more, the partial closure of certain public spaces such as the ChÃ¢teau de Versailles park deprived local residents of essential places to relax, creating a sense of frustration among residents.

        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>
                Rising in the cost of living
            </h2>
            <img src="../../images/hausse-tarifs.jpg" alt="">
            <p>
                The massive influx of visitors led to a temporary rise in prices in several sectors, including hotels, restaurants and services. In and around Paris, restaurant prices soared, making it more difficult for residents to find affordable meals. In addition, rents rose, particularly in neighborhoods close to Olympic venues such as Porte de Versailles, exacerbating social tensions.
            </p>
            <p>
                These increases were particularly felt by low-income households, who saw their purchasing power decline during the Games period, exacerbating feelings of social injustice.

                Risks to historical heritage
            </h2>
            <img src="../../images/tour-eiffel-degrade.png" alt="">
            <p>
                The large number of visitors to historic sites such as the ChÃ¢teau de Versailles and the Eiffel Tower has raised concerns about their preservation. Although protective measures have been put in place, experts have expressed concern about possible damage due to wear and tear, or to temporary arrangements made for the event. The risk of over-visiting these emblematic monuments remains a subject of debate.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>
                Feeling of social exclusion
            </h2>
            <p>
                Despite the fact that the Games were held on French soil, part of the population felt excluded from the event, not least because of the high cost of tickets for the competitions. These prices made it difficult for many families and local residents to access the competitions.
            </p>
            <p>
                What's more, the strong focus on foreign visitors and international economic spin-offs sometimes left local populations with the feeling that they were spectators, not players, in this global event. Residents of certain neighborhoods, such as La Goutte d'Or or ChÃ¢teau Rouge, felt that the benefits of the Olympics were mainly directed at foreign tourists.
